# Quantum-Cognitive Nexus Repository

Welcome to the **Quantum-Cognitive Nexus**!  
This repository was generated by an advanced, AI-powered, self-validating meta-repository generator that leverages document ingestion, quantum simulation, and multi-agent LLM debates to build modern, production-ready open-source projects.

## üß† What is This?

This project is an **example of a self-replicating, intelligent repository** generator. It can:

- Ingest your documents and knowledge sources (PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD, code, etc.)
- Summarize, embed, and quantum-process their content
- Use LLMs (Large Language Models) to simulate multi-role expert debates about your project
- Generate a production-ready, auditable open-source repository, including:
  - Code, documentation, tests
  - Debates and agent logs
  - Self-validation, manifests, and cryptographic provenance
  - GitHub publishing and CI/CD support

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. **Clone or Download**

You can use this repository as a template, or download the latest generated version.

### 2. **Install Requirements**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you want to use quantum features (optional):

```bash
pip install qiskit qiskit-aer
```

### 3. **Run the Generator**

To generate a new repository:

```bash
python self/generator/core.py
```

In Google Colab, simply upload your documents to `/content/`, then run the notebook version to get a downloadable zip or publish to GitHub.

## üìù Features

- **Document Ingestion:**  
  Upload your knowledge files (txt, md, pdf, docx, code, etc.) for context-aware repo generation.

- **AI/LLM Debate:**  
  Simulate a debate between agents (Quantum Ethicist, Cognitive Architect, Strategic Futurist) to guide project requirements, design, and ethics.

- **Quantum Simulation:**  
  Embeddings of your documents are processed with a quantum circuit simulator (Qiskit).

- **Open-Source Best Practices:**  
  Includes a full suite of open-source
